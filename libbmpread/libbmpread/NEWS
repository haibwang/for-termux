3.0 (2018 Feb. 02)
------------------

* Support for 16- and 32-bit bitmaps.
* Alpha channel support (available in 16- and 32-bit bitmap files).

2.1 (2016 Jul. 18)
------------------

* Added basic unit test suite.
* Even less undefined and implementation-defined behavior.  I believe that
  libbmpread will properly fail with error on maliciously crafted files that
  could before have led to buffer overruns or other undesirable outcomes.
* Some internal functions have been renamed or shuffled around.

2.0 (2016 Apr. 24)
------------------

* Less undefined and implementation-defined behavior, so libbmpread should work
  in more exotic environments.  I believe the only two requirements for the
  runtime environment now are that CHAR_BIT == 8 and integers are stored in
  two's complement, both of which are hard to avoid.
* To that end, the flags have been changed to unsigned ints (they were ints).
  This may require some code changes in consumers of this API.
* Some formatting, wording, and packaging tweaks.

1.1 (2005 Mar. 15)
------------------

* Added byte-swapping code for big-endian machines (libbmpread will now work on
  Macs!).  Thanks to Micah Tomblin for testing this for me.

1.0 (2005 Mar. 14)
------------------

* Initial version.
